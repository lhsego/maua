##' Calculate the log score for each observation
##' 
##' @details The column indicated by \code{truth} must be a factor whose levels indicate all possible classes.  The columns indicated by
##' \code{prob} must have names which contain the corresponding level names in the truth column.
##'
##' The log score is the natural logartihtm of the probability assigned to the true class.  It is calculated for each row separately.
##'
##' Note that for \code{scale = TRUE} and \code{scale = FALSE}, larger is better.
##'
##' Setting \code{scale = TRUE} scales the log score so that a negative score indicates the
##' classifier has done worse than guessing (i.e., worse than uniform probability assignmetns).  If the scale log score
##' is \emph{1}, the classifier has chosen perfectly by assigning probability \emph{1} to the correct class. 
##'
##' The linear transformation that takes place when \code{scale = TRUE} maps the log score, which ranges in \emph{[-Inf, 0]},
##' to \emph{[-Inf, 1]}.  A unform probability assignment receives a scaled log score of 0.
##' Additional information about the scaling is available in Section 3.2.1 of Holmes et al. (2013).

##' @export
##' @param X a data frame containing observations (i.e., instances, examples) on the rows, along with a truth column and
##' probability predictions for each class.  May contain other columns as well.
##'
##' @param truth A character string, logical vector, or numeric index that identifies the column in \code{X} that contains the
##' truth classes. This is passed to \href{http://pnnl.github.io/docs-Smisc/rd.html#selectelements}{selectElements()}
##' from the \href{http://pnnl.github.io/docs-Smisc}{Smisc} package.
##'
##' @param probs A character vector, logical vector, or vector of numeric indexes that identify the columns in \code{X} that contain
##' the predicted probabilities of the classes.  This is passed to
##' \href{http://pnnl.github.io/docs-Smisc/rd.html#selectelements}{selectElements()}.
##'
##' @param outCol A character string that indicates the name of the column that will contain the log scores.
##'
##' @param scale A logical indicating whether the log scores should be linearly scaled.  See Details.
##'
##' @return The data frame \code{X} is returned, with an appended column that contains the log scores.
